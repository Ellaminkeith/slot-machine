# Slot Machine

The player starts with 30 credits and can press the "Spin" button to generate a random number for each reel. If all three reels display the same number, the player wins and gains 1 credit. If the reels do not match, the player loses 1 credit. The game also includes a "Reset" button to restart the game. The current player credit and messages about the game result are displayed at the bottom of the game board.

# Planned future enhancements

1. Sound effects: Adding audio effects to the game would create a more immersive experience, especially when the player wins.
2. Improved visuals: Enhancing the game's visual design could make it more attractive and engaging to players. This could include adding more detailed graphics or animations, as well as a background that resembles a real casino.
3. Symbolic boards: Instead of using numbers on the slot machine boards, you could use symbols such as fruit or playing cards. This would make the game feel more like a traditional slot machine.
4. Multi-line slots: The current slot machine game only has one line, but adding multiple lines would increase the chances of winning and make the game more exciting.
5. Flexible betting amounts: Allowing players to flexibly their bet amounts would make the game more customizable.
